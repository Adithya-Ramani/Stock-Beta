# Stock Beta

In portfolio analysis, risk is measured by variance from expectation. The possibility that the expected returns may not be generated by the portfolio or the stock. This risk can be categorized into ‘Systematic Risk’ and ‘Unsystematic Risk’. 

Systematic risk is the risk at the macro level faced by the economy as a whole and diversification can’t help us mitigate this risk, as any stock will be influenced by the larger macro effects. Unsystematic Risk is the risk which is specific to the profile to the Company alone. Unsystematic risk can be reduced by diversification as not all companies may face a similar risk profile. Thus, diversification can help mitigate the unsystematic risk. 

The important question is how to measure this risk factor?
This systematic risk is measured using the ‘Beta’ coefficient. Beta is the volatility in the movement of an individual stock in relation to the volatility to the market index. It is calculated by regressing the security’s returns to the returns of the market index. 

•	β = 0: The portfolio/stock is uncorrelated with the market return.
•	β < 0: The portfolio/stock has an inverse correlation with the market return.
•	0 < β < 1: The portfolio/stock return is positively correlated with the market return however with smaller volatility.
•	β = 1: The portfolio return has a perfect correlation with the market portfolio return.
•	β > 1: The portfolio has a positive correlation with the market but would have price movements of greater magnitude.
